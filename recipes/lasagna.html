      <li>1/2 pound ground pork</li>
      <li>1/2 cup minced onion</li>

      <li>1 1/2 teaspoons dried basil</li>

      <li>1 16 ounce package of shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
      <li>3 large eggs</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Combine meats in skillet over medium-high heat, stirring until browned and crumbly for 5 to 7 minutes. Add onion and cook until translucent for roughly 5 minutes.</li>
      <li>Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, 1 tablespoon fresh parsley, garlic, basil, salt, oregano, and sugar. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer, stirring occasionally, for 30 minutes.</li>
      <li>While the sauce is simmering, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, 8 to 10 minutes. Drain and set aside. </li>
      <li> While the noodles are cooking, preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
      <li>Mix cottage cheese, Parmesan cheese, eggs, remaining 1 tablespoon fresh parsley, salt, and pepper in a large bowl until combined.</li>
      <li>Spread a spoon or two of sauce over the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish just to to coat it. Place two layers of noodles over the sauce to cover. Layer with 1/2 of the cheese mixture, 1/2 of the remaining sauce, and 1/2 of the mozzarella cheese. Repeat layers once more using the remaining noodles, cheese mixture, sauce, and mozzarella. Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil.</li>
      <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 30 to 40 minutes. Remove the foil and bake until cheese is golden brown, 5 to 10 more minutes.</li>
      <li>Remove from the oven and let stand for 10 minutes before cutting and serving.</li>
    </ol>
